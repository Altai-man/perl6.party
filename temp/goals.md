Take Your Time And Be Yourself


As some of you have heard, recently Firefox 57 "Quantum" was released.
It was marketed as being TWICE FASTER than earlier versions, using
word "concurrency" in the announcement, heavily coated with buzz words. Not
thinking much of it, I "upgraded" to the latest version.

To my shock and horror, everything I liked and used changed. The user
interface I got used to completely changed for no obvious to me reason, so I
have to re-learn it from scratch. The addon I use daily for web development
lost many of its features and was reduced from a toolbar to an icon that hides
everything under an extra click. And what about the "twice faster" claim? It
was faster at all, it wasn't anywhere close to twice.

I spent the next hour downgrading to an earlier version and fixing the damage.

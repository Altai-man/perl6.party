Imagine writing 10,000 lines of code and then throwing it all away.
Turns out when the client said "easy to use,"
they meant being able to access the app without a password, but you took it

with their account information. Ouch.

Our weather reporting app as
a script run by one user from command line will be vastly different than
the same app but run by millions of users per day from a Web application.

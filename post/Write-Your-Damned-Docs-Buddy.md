%% title: Write Your Damned Docs, Buddy!

%% desc: Like... seriously!

Today, I spent 3 hours figuring out how a single partially documented subroutine
works and making decisions on which parts of the undocumented behaviour to
keep, because users might be relying on it. It's now nearly midnight, but
my brain is wide awake, because I also just spent an hour and a half digging
through commits and a year worth of chat logs because someone suggested the
new doc-contradicting behaviour might've been done on purpose... for a reason.
So why don't the docs reflect that possible reason?

So this is a rant. It's not addressed to anyone involved in today's incident nor
to the reader of this post, but to you, buddy. All of you who ever wasted
anyone's time by never bothering to write down two damn sentences explaining how
your code is meant to work.

I don't need to dig through algorithms, trying to understand all the ranges of
inputs and all the outputs they produce. Just write your damned docs, buddy!

I don't need to sift through mathematical formulae on Wikipedia and then do calculations trying to derive the formula YOU used in your code. Just write your damned docs, buddy!

I don't need to set up and boot a server just to see how your code handles it. Just write your damned docs, buddy!

I'm an idiot. I swear! I'm too stupid to understand code. So just write your damned docs, buddy!

When did it become socially acceptable to write code without accompanying documentation? We don't write code for humans. We write code for computers
because they're too stupid to understand plain English. Code is not easy to
understand! If it were, we wouldn't call it CODE! Reading your code is not
the only issue when the docs are lacking. We also don't know whether
your code is WORKING CORRECTLY!

No one should care what's underneath the hood of your subroutine. All we want
to know is were the pedals are! You don't need to write a novel. It doesn't
even need to spelled right! Just write SOMETHING!

Seriously. Stop being a giant dick and write your damned docs, buddy!

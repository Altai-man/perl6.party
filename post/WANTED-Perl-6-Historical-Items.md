%% desc: A call to collect memorabilia for a Perl 6 museum

The Perl 6 programming language had a turbulent birth. It was announced in
summer of 2000 and the first stable language release shipped out only 2 years
ago, on Christmas, 2015. A lot has happened during that decade and a half,
yet the details are hard to piece together.

After my recent facelift to [rakudo.org](https://rakudo.org/), I'm
working on (a second) facelift to [perl6.org](https://perl6.org) website.

Part of the work involves bringing all the Perl 6 deliverables under one umbrella, so the user isn't thrown around multiple websites, trying to find what to install. At the same time, we want to strengthen the distinction between Perl 6 the language and the compilers that implement it, as well as encourage more implementors to give it a go at implementing a Perl 6 programming language compiler.

The Perl 6 Programming Language Museum will be part of that effort and along with interesting tidbits of Perl 6 history, it'll showcase past implementation attempts that may no longer be in active development today. Since I don't know much about what happened before I came to the language sometime in 2015, I need your help in collecting those tidbits.

In my mind's eye, I'm imagining a few pages on perl6.org; something in the same vein as [Computer History Museum's pages](http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/software-languages/)â€”pictures, years, and info, and potentially links to code repositories. I'm looking for:

- Descriptions of interesting/significant events (like the mug throwing incident).
- Descriptions of interesting/significant implementations of Perl 6 or influential Perl 6 projects. Having links to repos/tarballs of their code is a plus.
- Samples of interesting/significant email threads or chat logs.
- Pictures of interesting/significant objects (first sight at plush Camelias?).
- Pictures of interesting/significant humans ([a filled out model release form is required](https://github.com/perl6/museum-items/blob/master/MODEL-RELEASE-FORM.md)).
- Anything else that's Museum worthy.

If you have any of these items, please submit them to the appropriate year directory in the [Perl 6 Museum Items repository](https://github.com/perl6/museum-items). If you're a member of Perl 6 GitHub org, you should already have a commit bit to that repo. Otherwise, submit your items via a pull request.

Let's build something cool and interesting for the people using Perl 6 a hundred years from now to look at and remember!

If you have any questions or need help, [talk to a human on our IRC chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6).

%% desc: Overview of Perl 6's novel regex syntax and grammars

Last week I gave a "Intro Into Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars" talk at the Toronto
Perl Mongers, whom I thank for letting me speak.

For google hangout that is usually set up, we got to use the fancy equipment provided by the company that was letting us use their space. Unfortunately,
it's currently unclear if the hangout was recorded and if there would be a video
of the talk.

So, I figured I'd make a screencast of the talk. You won't get some of the discussions that occurred during the meeting, but the content of the talk
itself is pretty much identical.

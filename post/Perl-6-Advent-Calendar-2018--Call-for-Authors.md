%% desc: Write a blog post about Perl 6

Every year since 2009, the Perl 6 community publishes a Perl 6
advent calendar, in the form of blog posts on [perl6advent.wordpress.com](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com).

To keep up this great tradition, we need 24 blog posts, and volunteers who
write them. If you want to contribute a blog post about anything related to
Perl 6, please add your name (and potentially also a topic already) to
[the schedule](https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/perl6advent-2018/schedule), and if you don't yet have a login on [the advent blog](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com), please
tell [Zoffix](https://twitter.com/zoffix/) or someone on
[#perl6 IRC chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6) your email
address so that they can send you an invitation to Wordpress for the site.

Perl 6 advent blog posts should be finished the day before they are due, and published on midnight (UTC) of the due date as publishing date.

If you have any questions, or want to discuss blog post ideas, please join on the [#perl6 IRC channel on irc.freenode.org](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6).

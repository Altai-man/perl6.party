*I pop open my code editor and start laying the groundwork for my next awesome
tool! It'll save a ton of time and make things a lot easier for
[my favourite open source project](https://github.com/perl6/). But something
doesn't feel right. The excitement is dulled by this nagging feeling in my
chest. The feeling that I rather be doing something else, while at the same
time feeling that what I'm doing right now is my favourite thing to do. That
feeling is a burn out about to happen and I know I have to check out and take
a nice long break. So I do...*

Burn outs suck because they prevent you from doing what you love—really bad
ones can mess you up for several months and having missed so much, you may
never come back to a project at all.

I'm not a doctor and can't tell you why they happen. The way I trained
myself to spot a burn out oncoming was through years of burning out, trying
something new, burning out, and so on. I'm an expert burning out in...

And if I had a spare liver, I'd likely burn myself out drinking beer too.

So I won't tell you how to avoid a burn out. I'll tell you how to reliably
get one. Let's jump in, shall we!

### 1. Your GitHub Contributor Graph Shows How Well You're Doing

If you use GitHub, your [profile page](https://github.com/zoffixznet/) contains
a contributor graph that's a good indicator of how close you are to a burn out.
Here's mine:

The obvious mistake I made was move to a new place and then get deathly ill
for several weeks in February—you don't want any empty squares, if you're
hoping for a burn out. Light squares are bad. Dark squares are good.
(Anyone else is thinking of toast?)

### 2. When You Become a Cranky Bitch, You're Well On Your Way There

If in the middle of attaining more dark squares on GitHub, you start being
nasty to people. Don't panic! This just means that it's working! A burn out
can be only a few days around the corner if you just keep this up.

    before that last comment, they would get the wrong idea about this<br>community<br>
> <b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> b2gills, I don't really care. It's a long weekend.<br>
    I spent most of my personal time fixing bugs for free. And at the end<br>
    of the day someone is telling me they have an issue with my saying<br>
    *'Thank you for the report'* when I resolve the bugs.<br>
> <b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> AlexDaniel, set up an email filter if it<br>
    bothers you that much, dick.

Be sure to use lots of profanity and point out how the person is just
distracting you from doing more work on your open source project. To score
bonus points, write a blog post about the incident. However, don't
make the mistake of doing it *instead* of writing more code, but rather
*stay up* an extra couple of hours—trust me, sleep deprivation is
burnout's best friend.

But what if people don't annoy you just yet? Is there anything you can
do? I'm so glad you asked!

### 3. Give Your Opinion On Everything—People Need You!

Be sure to subscribe to as many notifications as possible. Try to
aim for at least 30 notifications per day.

Keep an eye out for issues you can [bikeshed](http://bikeshed.com/).
Those can be [argued about for days](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/577),
without requiring to expend any brain power. When you're aiming for a
burnout, these will serve as your time to "rest."

People's opinions soon enough will start to annoy you, so don't shy away from
profanity (see previous step!). You wouldn't want to just walk away when
[someone is wrong on the Internet!](https://xkcd.com/386/)

Getting to profanity can be more easily achieved if you respond
to notifications on projects that don't need your involvement and that you
don't follow regularly, so when someone points out that you're missing some
info, call them a dick and tell them you're too busy writing code and can't be
expected to follow all of the conversations!

And speaking of following conversations...

### 4. Read The Chatlogs—It's What They're There For

Burning out by trying to respond to a lot of notifications has an obvious flaw:
it relies on other humans make those notifications. This is why it's important
to follow [chat logs](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/today), spotting anything
that could use a comment. Then, even if you're on the go, you can just join
in and save the day.

> <b>&lt;sena_kun&gt;</b> How can I get X::TypeCheck::Splice exception?<br>
> <b>&lt;ZoffixMobile&gt;</b> Other than throwing it directly?<br>
> <b>&lt;sena_kun&gt;</b> ZoffixMobile, other than.<br>
> <b>&lt;ZoffixMobile&gt;</b> m: X::TypeCheck::Splice.new.throw<br>

Tip: constantly joining from all the locations you happen to be following the
chatlogs from can be quite annoying. Use [weechat](http://weechat.org/) running
via [`screen`](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/) on
your online server, so you could keep it open and ready to go from whereever
you are.

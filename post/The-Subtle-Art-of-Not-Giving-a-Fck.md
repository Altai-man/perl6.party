If I were to pick a single book to recommend, it'd be
[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713), by Mark Manson. It's a bit tough to
digest and isn't an immersive read, but I think it has several great—even if
counter-intuitive—ideas in it.

Recently, I noticed a trend in discussions the Perl 6 community spends its time on that reminded me of that book and how applicable the book's ideas are.

In addition, I find some of these discussion range from mildly annoying to borderline depressing. The precise kind of atmosphere that made me leave Perl 5 and its community. So, I'd like to stomp out this attitude early in Perl 6 and invite the entire community to give fewer fcks.

## The Self-Fulfilling Profecy

Imagine you're tasked with writing a screenplay. It's about a young man who is
trying to win over the heart of a young woman. He's very thin and isn't much to look at. He's very inscure. He's desperate.

How would you write this person? How would he behave?

He'd probably speak in a quiet voice, often mumbling some the words. A nervous
laughter, on occasion, would accompany his darting gaze, betraying his self-
doubt. The desperation would cause him to be a mindless yes-man to her,
obscuring his own personality. And late at night, he'd lay in bed, recounting
the events of the day, and wonder whether she even likes him.

While plenty of romantic comedies made a quick buck on characters like that, in
real life such a person would be obnoxious, boring, and unbearable. Second-guessing one's decisions, throwing away one's goals and ambitions at the
slightest critique, and trying to please everyone are a sure-fire way to make bad decisions, have no goals, and being liked by no one. The fears that consume our timid hero become a self-fullfilling profecy: the woman indeed ends up not liking him, essentially because of how hard he was trying to make her like him.

I notice a strong similarity to that scenario in the community discussions
about Perl 6's popularity. Positive trends, such as recent survey showing over
30% of people already using Perl 6 at work, go with barely a notice, yet a dip of a couple of percetage points for "Perl" (not even "Perl 6"!) in some obscure
"language popularity" ranking that uses questionable methodology cause a panic and the prophesying of The End of Times. This is insecurity.

I also see comparison to other languages that for some reason attempt to
portray Perl 6 as the loser: Perl 6 is bigger than language X; Perl 6 has more symbol-based syntax than language Y; Perl 6 has more ways to do a thing than
language Z. It is the personality of our language and it's perfectly fine to have people who don't like those things to not like our language. Otherwise, this is trying to please everyone.

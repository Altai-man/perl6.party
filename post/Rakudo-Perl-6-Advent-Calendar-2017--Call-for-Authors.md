%% desc: Write a blog post about Rakudo Perl 6

Every year since 2009, the Rakudo Perl 6 community publishes a Rakudo Perl 6
advent calendar, in the form of blog posts on [perl6advent.wordpress.com](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com).

To keep up this great tradition, we need 24 blog posts, and volunteers who
write them. If you want to contribute a blog post about anything related to
Rakudo Perl 6, please add your name (and potentially also a topic already) to
[the schedule](https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/perl6advent-2017/schedule), and if you don't yet have a login on [the advent blog](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com), please
tell [Zoffix](https://twitter.com/zoffix/) or someone on
[#perl6 IRC chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6) your email
address so that they can send you an invitation.

Rakudo Perl 6 advent blog posts should be finished the day before they are due, and published with midnight (UTC) of the due date as publishing date.

If you have any questions, or want to discuss blog post ideas, please join on the [#perl6 IRC channel on irc.freenode.org](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6).
